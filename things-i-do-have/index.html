<p>R﻿andom things:</p>
<p>1﻿) Dedicate a clean toothbrush to your cleaning supplies. Use this to get into tiny crevices that a sponge can't get into.</p>
<p>2﻿) Cheap felt gloves are really cheap. I take these and I cut off the finger tips so that I have a pair of inexpensive fingerless gloves. These fit well under normal gloves, so that when you take your gloves off to do something, most of your hand is still covered by something, but your finger tips being exposed gives you the dexterity to accomplish the task.</p>
