I﻿ don't have any recommendations for products as I haven't started down the chicken... rabbit... hole but I spent a good deal of time looking into how to build a coop and run.

**C﻿oop vs Run**

A﻿ coop is where they live and where they lay eggs.

A﻿ run is a secured area where they play and can run around. People who free range sometimes choose to have a run as well so that their yardbirds can be locked up away from predators if they go out of own. A lot of people also choose to free range during the day and lock their chickens up at night.

C﻿oops and Runs are often combined, and the chickens often have access to both areas 24/7 but will often naturally choose to go inside the coop when sleeping.
