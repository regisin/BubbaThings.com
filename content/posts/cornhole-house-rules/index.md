House Rules:

1. Place boards 27 ft apart, front to front. (Regulation Distance)
2. Rock, Paper, Scissors decides who throws first. R.P.S. should always be best of three. 
3. Begin each game between new competitors with one warm up inning. Everyone (both teams) throws four bags each.
4. Opposing players on the same end of the court must alternate throwing bags until each player has thrown all four bags. (Regulation Rule)
5. Bags must be thrown underhand and from behind the front edge of the board. (Regulation Rule)
6. Use cancellation scoring. The points of one team cancel out the points of their opponent. Only one team can score in each inning. (Regulation Rule)
7. Points system (Regulation Rules):

   \- A “Woody” (a bag on the board) is 1 point. The bag may not touch the grass, the ground, or a bag touching the grass or the ground. 

   \-A “Cornhole” (a bag fully in the hole) is 3 points. Fun Note: A throw directly into the hole is called an Airmail!
8. Bags do not count and must be removed from the board (Regulation Rules) if they: 

   \- Are thrown out of turn, 

   \- Are thrown from in front of the board, or

   \- Touch anything before landing on the board (e.g., grass, ground, tree, powerline, human)
9. The team that scores points in the prior inning throws first the following inning. If neither team scores points, the throwing order remains the same. (Regulation Rule)
10. First team to **hit or exceed** 21 points at the end of an inning wins. (Regulation Rule) If the winners play the next game, they keep the board and decide who throws first.
