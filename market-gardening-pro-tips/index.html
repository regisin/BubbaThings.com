<p>Jang Seeder:</p>
<p>- W﻿hen creating in-row spacing with the Jang Seeder, use the plow to plant the individual rows. Don't use the wheel. You can get closer spacing by watching the plow itself. </p>
<p>T﻿he plow will create ridges between your rows, you can push the seeder over (through) these ridges to get a row down the middle of your two lines of seeds</p>
<p>-﻿ Use a sharpie and write Gear Side on the side of the hopper that the gear nut needs to be on.</p>
<p>-﻿ Use a sharpie and write the number of the gears (9,10,11, ect.) on both sides of the gears so that when the gear is in the seeder, you can see what gear it is, without having to turn the gear around.</p>
<p><strong>G﻿reens Wash Tub:</strong> Don't drill a hole in the tub until you figure out where the piping is going. I drilled my hole in the tub because this looked the nicest, but in reality, it's now under the PVC piping. It should have been placed off center, so that I can direct water and leafy greens down it without having the PVC pipe directly over the top of it.</p>
